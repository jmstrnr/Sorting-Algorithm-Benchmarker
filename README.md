# Sorting-Algorithm-Benchmarker

This application runs various sorting algorithms and compares their average running time for different input sizes.

Algorithms used: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Counting Sort

To test how the algorithms handle inputs of various sizes, it uses arrays of random integers, ranging from size 100 to size 10000.
Each algorithm is run multiple times for each input size to find the average running time for the specified algorithm to sort that input size in milliseconds.

Languages used: Java
